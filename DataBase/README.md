## Overview

This guide provides instructions for setting up, managing, and utilizing the MySQL database for GUIDE-seq experimental data.

## Database Design

To build the database optimally:

- **3NF Algorithm**: We applied the Third Normal Form (3NF) algorithm to structure the tables. This ensures effective data updatingâ€”any additions or changes do not require updates to multiple tables or columns, and it prevents redundant information.
- **Simplicity**: We maintained a straightforward design to facilitate easy querying and maintenance by laboratory personnel.

The database consists of approximately 8 tables. The central table is **guide_seq_data**, which contains the results of the experiments. This table is linked to other tables providing details about the analysis, the wet experiment, and links to raw information.

## Database Schema

**Tables:**

1. **CELL**: Contains information about cell types used in experiments.
2. **Experiment**: Stores names of experiments in the format `GUIDE_NAME-REPLICATE`.
3. **RawData**: Links experiments and cell types to raw data files.
4. **GUIDE**: Information about GUIDE sequences.
5. **experiment_parameter**: Details including experiment type, cell, guide, and additional information.
6. **Identified**: Links to files with identified results.
7. **Analysis_parameter**: Parameters related to analysis such as package version and Python version.
8. **GUIDE-Seq data**: Results from GUIDE-seq experiments.

For detailed schema information, refer to the [Schema Documentation](DataBase/DATABASE schema - explanation.pdf).

## Database Files

In the **DatabaseFiles** folder, you will find SQL files for creating tables and loading information into the database via MySQL.

For more information, see the [DatabaseFiles folder]([DataBase/DatabaseFiles](https://github.com/reutlev98/CRISPR-Database-Development-Analysis-Project/tree/76b52a76c1bea5a325ede3f49a596893d0e462c1/DataBase/DatabaseFiles)).

## Queries

The **Queries** folder contains SQL queries designed for analyzing the data in the database.

For more information, see the [Queries folder](DataBase/Queries).

## Uploading New Data

The **UploadNewData** tool facilitates the uploading of new data into the database. The web interface allows users to input parameters and upload files.

For more information, see the [Upload New Data folder](DataBase/UploadNewData).
